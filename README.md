# Simon-Game

The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 19781. The game challenges players to remember and repeat sequences of lights and sounds. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more complex, testing the playerâ€™s short-term memory and concentration skills.
